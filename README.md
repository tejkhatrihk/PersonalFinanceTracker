# PersonalFinanceTracker

A simple personal finance tracking application built with .NET 8 Blazor Web App. This project allows users to add and view financial transactions, stored in a SQLite database. Features include a form to input transaction details (amount, date, description) and a table to display all transactions. The app is designed for ease of use and serves as a foundation for learning Blazor, Entity Framework Core, and Git.

### Features
- Add transactions with amount, date, and description.
- View all transactions in a clean table format.
- SQLite database integration with EF Core migrations.
- Bootstrap-styled UI with navigation bar.

### Future Plans
- Add user authentication to track transactions per user.
- Enhance with categories and financial summaries.
